MediQuery is an intelligent healthcare analytics copilot that transforms natural language questions into actionable medical insights. Built on MindsDB's AI infrastructure, it enables hospitals, clinics, and researchers to analyze patient feedback, satisfaction surveys, and treatment effectiveness without writing complex SQL queries.

## � Probledm Statement

### The Healthcare Analytics Challenge

Healthcare organizations collect vast amounts of patient feedback data but struggle to extract actionable insights due to:

**🔍 Data Accessibility Issues:**
- Patient feedback scattered across multiple systems (surveys, reviews, forms)
- Technical barriers preventing non-technical staff from accessing insights
- Time-consuming manual analysis of unstructured text data

**📊 Analysis Limitations:**
- Traditional BI tools require SQL expertise and technical training
- Static dashboards don't answer ad-hoc questions from clinical staff
- Semantic search capabilities missing for finding relevant patient experiences

**⏱️ Operational Inefficiencies:**
- Hours spent manually categorizing and analyzing patient feedback
- Delayed identification of satisfaction trends and quality issues
- Inability to quickly correlate patient sentiment with operational metrics

### The MediQuery Solution

MediQuery solves these challenges by providing:

- **Natural Language Interface** — Ask questions in plain English, get instant insights
- **Semantic Search** — Find relevant patient experiences using context, not just keywords  
- **Real-time Analytics** — Live insights from streaming patient feedback data
- **Zero Technical Barrier** — Clinicians and administrators can analyze data without SQL knowledge
- **Automated Categorization** — AI-powered classification of feedback themes and sentiment

### Use Cases Solved

1. **Quality Improvement Teams** — Identify satisfaction trends and improvement opportunities
2. **Department Managers** — Monitor departmental performance and patient experience metrics
3. **Clinical Leadership** — Understand patient sentiment around specific treatments or procedures
4. **Patient Experience Officers** — Track NPS scores and satisfaction drivers across the organization
5. **Researchers** — Analyze patient outcomes and treatment effectiveness from feedback data

## ✨ Key Features

- **🤖 Conversational AI Agent** — Natural language to SQL query transformation
- **🧠 Semantic Knowledge Base** — Intelligent search through patient feedback with context understanding
- **📊 Real-time Analytics** — Live insights from patient satisfaction surveys and reviews
- **🔍 Metadata-Aware Filtering** — Filter by department, patient type, date ranges, and more
- **⚡ Zero-ETL Architecture** — Works directly with live data sources (Google Sheets, databases)
- **🎯 Interactive Dashboard** — User-friendly Streamlit interface with charts and visualizations
- **🔌 RESTful API** — FastAPI backend for easy integration with existing systems


## Sample queries 

1) What is the average patient satisfaction by department, and which departments have the lowest treatment effectiveness ratings?

2) For cardiology patients with low treatment effectiveness ratings, what other complaints appear in their feedback?

3) How does wait time correlate with patient recommendations across all departments?

4) Which department has the best doctor communication?

    },
    prompt_template = 'You have access to patient_reviews_kb with columns: department, overall_rating, treatment_effectiveness, doctor_communication, wait_time, recommendation. Analyze satisfaction trends, detect concerns, and summarize outcomes by department.';
```

### 4. Set Up Auto-Sync (Optional)

Keep your knowledge base updated automatically:

    INSERT INTO patient_reviews_kb
    SELECT * FROM patient_feedback_source.patient_reviews
    WHERE review_id NOT IN (
        SELECT id FROM patient_reviews_kb
    )
) EVERY 6 hours;
```
ent
SELECT answer FROM department_analysis 
WHERE question = 'What is the average patient satisfaction by department? Include sample size and standard deviation.';

-- Identify underperforming departments
SELECT answer FROM department_analysis 
WHERE question = 'Which departments have ratings below 3.5 and what are the main complaint categories?';

-- Trend analysis
SELECT answer FROM department_analysis 
WHERE question = 'How has patient satisfaction changed over the last 6 months by department?';
```

#### 2. Operational Insights

```sql

    avg_rating,
    sample_size,

### Predictive Analytics Metrics

#### Risk Indicators

```sql
-- Patient satisfaction risk scoring
SELECT 
    department,
    AVG(CASE 
        WHEN wait_time_minutes > 45 AND doctor_communication < 4 THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END) * 100 as high_risk_percentage,
    AVG(CASE 
        WHEN overall_rating <= 2 THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END) * 100 as detractor_rate,
    COUNT(*) as total_encounters
FROM mindsdb.patient_reviews_kb 
WHERE visit_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY high_risk_percentage DESC;
```

### Business Impact Metrics

#### ROI and Value Metrics

| Business Metric | Calculation Method | Expected Impact |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Patient Retention Value** | `Retention Rate × Average Patient Value` | Revenue protection |
| **Referral Generation** | `NPS Score × Patient Volume × Referral Rate` | New patient acquisition |
| **Operational Efficiency** | `Satisfaction Score ÷ Cost per Patient` | Resource optimization |
| **Quality Improvement ROI** | `(Satisfaction Increase × Patient Volume × LTV)` | Investment justification |

#### Performance Benchmarking

```sql
-- Comparative performance analysis
SELECT 
    department,
    AVG(overall_rating) as current_satisfaction,
    (SELECT AVG(overall_rating) FROM patient_reviews_kb WHERE visit_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 YEAR) AND DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)) as baseline_satisfaction,
    AVG(overall_rating) - (SELECT AVG(overall_rating) FROM patient_reviews_kb WHERE visit_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 2 YEAR) AND DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)) as improvement,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(overall_rating) DESC) as satisfaction_rank
FROM mindsdb.patient_reviews_kb 
WHERE visit_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
GROUP BY department;
```
